abstract = {The exact error probability of quadriphase shift keying (QPSK) signals                        with homodyne crosstalk is derived analytically. With respect to the signal,                        homodyne crosstalk may be from the same, the worst, or random polarization.                        Valid for many interferers, Gaussian model overestimates the SNR penalty for                        homodyne crosstalk from a single interferer. For 1-dB SNR penalty, QPSK                        signal may tolerate up to a crosstalk ratio of -16.3 dB from a single interferer from the worst                        polarization alignment.},

abstract = {Few-mode fibers (FMFs) are used for the first time to transmit over 5000 km. Ten WDM channels with 50GHz channel spacing at 112 Gb/s per channel using PDM-QPSK are launched into the fundamental mode of the FMFs by splicing single-mode fibers directly to the FMFs. Even though few-mode fibers can support an additional spatial mode LP11 at 1550 nm, the signal remains in the fundamental mode and does not experience mode coupling throughout fiber transmission. After each span the signal is collected by a second single-mode fiber which is also spliced to the FMF. Span loss is compensated by single-mode EDFAs before it is launched to the next FMF span. The lack of mode coupling ensures that the signal does not suffer any impairments that may result from differential mode delay or excess loss. Therefore the FMFs used in this ``single-mode operation'' have the same bandwidth as single-mode fibers. Experimental results verified that FMFs have the significant advantage of large core size which reduces the nonlinear impairments suffered by the signal. It is shown that FMFs with an effective area of 130 $\mu$m2, have an optimum launch power 2 dB higher compared to standard single-mode fibers and as a result a 1.1 dB improvement in the Q-factor is obtained after 3000 km.},

Our focus is on settling the discrepancy between the results of the Gaussian noise (GN) model (according to which NLIN is additive Gaussian) and a recently published time-domain analysis, which attributes drastically different properties to the NLIN. Upon reviewing the two approaches we identify several unjustified assumptions that are key in the derivation of the GN model, and that are responsible for the discrepancy. We derive the true NLIN power and verify that the NLIN is not additive Gaussian, but rather it depends strongly on the data transmitted in the channel of interest. In addition we validate the time-domain model numerically and demonstrate the strong dependence of the NLIN on the interfering channels' modulation format.},

abstract = {The GN-model has been proposed as an approximate but sufficiently accurate tool for predicting uncompensated optical coherent transmission system performance, in realistic scenarios. For this specific use, the GN-model has enjoyed substantial validation, both simulative and experimental. Recently, however, it has been pointed out that its predictions, when used to obtain a detailed picture of non-linear interference (NLI) noise accumulation along a link, may be affected by a substantial NLI overestimation error, especially in the first spans of the link. In this paper we analyze in detail the GN-model errors. We discuss recently proposed formulas for correcting such errors and show that they neglect several contributions to NLI, so that they may substantially underestimate NLI in specific situations, especially over low-dispersion fibers. We derive a complete set of formulas accounting for all single, cross, and multi-channel effects, This set constitutes what we have called the enhanced GN-model (EGN-model). We extensively validate the EGN model by comparison with accurate simulations in several different system scenarios. The overall EGN model accuracy is found to be very good when assessing detailed span-by-span NLI accumulation and excellent when estimating realistic system maximum reach. The computational complexity vs. accuracy trade-offs of the various versions of the GN and EGN models are extensively discussed.},

The large-effective-area nature of the FMF fundamental modes improves system nonlinear tolerance in the expense of mode coupling along FMF transmissions which induces multi-path interference (MPI) and needs to be compensated. We analytically investigate 6-spatial-polarization mode QSM transmission systems in presence of MPI and show that in the weak coupling regime, the QSM channel is a Gaussian random process in frequency. MPI compensation filters are derived and performance penalties due to MPI and signal loss from higher-order modes are characterized. We also experimentally demonstrate 256 Gb/s polarization multiplexed (PM)-16-QAM QSM transmissions over a record distance of 2600 km with 100-km span using decision directed least mean square (DD-LMS) algorithm for MPI compensation.},

	abstract = {Using multimode fibers for long-haul transmission is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. In particular few-mode fibers (FMFs) are demonstrated as a good compromise since they are sufficiently resistant to mode coupling compared to standard multimode fibers but they still can have large core diameters compared to single-mode fibers. As a result these fibers can have significantly less nonlinearity and at the same time they can have the same performance as single-mode fibers in terms of dispersion and loss. In the absence of mode coupling it is possible to use these fibers in the single-mode operation where all the data is carried in only one of the spatial modes throughout the fiber. It is shown experimentally that the single-mode operation is achieved simply by splicing single-mode fibers to both ends of a 35-km-long dual-mode fiber at 1310 nm. After 35 km of transmission, no modal dispersion or excess loss was observed. Finally the same fiber is placed in a recirculating loop and 3 WDM channels each carrying 6 Gb/s BPSK data were transmitted through1050 km of the few-mode fiber without modal dispersion.},

Spatial mode filters are added to suppress undesired higher order modes. We transmit 30-Gbaud QPSK signals over 60 WDM channels, 3 spatial modes, and 2 polarizations, reaching a distance of 310 km based on a 44.3 km long span. We also report about transmission experiments over 6 spatial modes for a 17-km single-span experiment. The results indicate that multimode fibers support scalable mode-division multiplexing approaches, where modes can be added over time if desired. Also the results indicate that mode-multiplexed transmission distance over 300 km are possible in conventional multimode fibers.},

	abstract = {We explore the potential benefits of digital nonlinearity compensation (NLC) techniques in fully loaded coherent wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) transmission systems. After providing an overview of the various classes of nonlinear interference noise (NLIN) and digital signal processing approaches for their mitigation, we consider the two practically most relevant digital NLC methods known today: back-propagation (BP) and equalization of nonlinear phase and polarization rotation noise (PPRN). We consider a wide range of system configurations including a variety of modulation formats from quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) to 256-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), single-carrier and digital subcarrier multiplexed (SCM) optical superchannels, as well as both point-to-point line systems and optically routed networks (ORNs). Using theoretical predictions from the time-domain model for NLIN, we show that the gain in peak signal-to-noise ratio in fully loaded WDM systems using single-channel and three-channel joint BP is typically limited to 0.5 and 1 dB. The additional gain provided by increasing the number of jointly back-propagated channels beyond three is limited to 0.1 dB per additional back-propagated channel. The remarkably slow growth of the BP gain with the bandwidth of the back-propagated signal is shown to apply also for systems in which the receiver employs PPRN removal. We additionally explore the potential benefits of SCM across a wide range of system configurations, including the impact of BP and PPRN removal on SCM systems. We show that while the BP gain is similar to single-carrier systems, PPRN removal can have a much stronger effect, particularly for higher order QAM systems, implying that SCM can be advantageous not only for constant modulus formats such as QPSK, but also for high spectral efficiency systems. In the context of ORNs, we find that SCM not only improves system tolerance to nonlinearities, but also induces significantly smaller performance variations in various ORN scenarios.},

	abstract = {We describe a method to estimate the capacity limit of fiber-optic communication systems      (or ``fiber channels'') based on information theory. This paper is divided      into two parts. Part 1 reviews fundamental concepts of digital communications and information      theory. We treat digitization and modulation followed by information theory for channels both      without and with memory. We provide explicit relationships between the commonly used      signal-to-noise ratio and the optical signal-to-noise ratio. We further evaluate the      performance of modulation constellations such as quadrature-amplitude modulation, combinations      of amplitude-shift keying and phase-shift keying, exotic constellations, and concentric rings      for an additive white Gaussian noise channel using coherent detection. Part 2 is devoted      specifically to the ``fiber channel.'' We review the physical phenomena present in      transmission over optical fiber networks, including sources of noise, the need for optical      filtering in optically-routed networks, and, most critically, the presence of fiber Kerr      nonlinearity. We describe various transmission scenarios and impairment mitigation techniques,      and define a fiber channel deemed to be the most relevant for communication over      optically-routed networks. We proceed to evaluate a capacity limit estimate for this fiber      channel using ring constellations. Several scenarios are considered, including uniform and      optimized ring constellations, different fiber dispersion maps, and varying transmission      distances. We further present evidences that point to the physical origin of the fiber      capacity limitations and provide a comparison of recent record experiments with our capacity      limit estimation.},

The closed-form solutions include the results for the achievable Q factor, optimum launch power density, nonlinear threshold of launch power density, and information spectral efficiency limit. These analytical results clearly identify their dependence on system parameters including fiber dispersion, number of spans, dispersion compensation ratio, and overall bandwidth. The closed-form solution is further substantiated by numerical simulations using distributed nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation.},

The results show that first order distributed Raman systems are superior to the discretely amplified systems in terms of the nonlinear Kerr compensation efficiency that a mid-link OPC can achieve.

This theory is based on the regular perturbation treatment of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which governs the wave propagation in the optical fiber, and is exact up to the first order in the fiber nonlinear coefficient. It takes into account all cross-channel nonlinear four-wave mixing contributions to the total variance of nonlinear distortions, dependency on modulation format, erbium-doped fiber and backward Raman amplification schemes, heterogeneous spans, and chromatic dispersion to all orders; moreover, it is computationally efficient. This theory is used to estimate the impact of the signal-noise interaction on the unmitigated, as well as on the nonlinearity-mitigated systems with ideal multi-channel digital backpropagation, and to study the fundamental limits of zero-forcing nonlinear equalization of the fiber-optic coherent transmission systems.},

	abstract = {The last few years have seen a wealth of new nonlinear propagation modeling results appear in the literature, especially regarding coherent systems operating in the absence of optical dispersion compensation. One of the most prolific lines of research, though not the only one, has been that of improvements and upgrades to the Gaussian-noise (GN) model, which have also led to the so-called enhanced GN model, or EGN model. In addition, many specific aspects of nonlinear propagation, including format and symbol-rate dependence of nonlinearity generation, long-correlated nonlinear phase and polarization noise, the effect of copropagating amplified spontaneous emission noise and distributed amplification, and still others, have been focused on and several new related results have been published. This has been a very positive trend but, from the viewpoint of the end users, such as system and network designers, this large body of new knowledge may have been found difficult to sort out. The question of when and whether more sophisticated models are truly needed in any given system/network scenario, for a given set of accuracy and computational complexity constraints, then naturally arises. This paper tries to address this practical issue and provide indications regarding possible effective solution to varied end-users' requirements.},

	abstract = {Fiber-optic communication systems are nowadays facing serious challenges due to the fast growing demand on capacity from various new applications and services. It is now well recognized that nonlinear effects limit the spectral efficiency and transmission reach of modern fiber-optic communications. Nonlinearity compensation is therefore widely believed to be of paramount importance for increasing the capacity of future optical networks. Recently, there has been steadily growing interest in the application of a powerful mathematical tool---the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT)---in the development of fundamentally novel nonlinearity mitigation tools for fiber-optic channels. It has been recognized that, within this paradigm, the nonlinear crosstalk due to the Kerr effect is effectively absent, and fiber nonlinearity due to the Kerr effect can enter as a constructive element rather than a degrading factor. The novelty and the mathematical complexity of the NFT, the versatility of the proposed system designs, and the lack of a unified vision of an optimal NFT-type communication system, however, constitute significant difficulties for communication researchers. In this paper, we therefore survey the existing approaches in a common framework and review the progress in this area with a focus on practical implementation aspects. First, an overview of existing key algorithms for the efficacious computation of the direct and inverse NFT is given, and the issues of accuracy and numerical complexity are elucidated. We then describe different approaches for the utilization of the NFT in practical transmission schemes. After that we discuss the differences, advantages, and challenges of various recently emerged system designs employing the NFT, as well as the spectral efficiency estimates available up-to-date. With many practical implementation aspects still being open, our mini-review is aimed at helping researchers assess the perspectives, understand the bottlenecks, and envision the development paths in the upcoming NFT-based transmission technologies.},

	abstract = {We investigate the accuracy of wideband split-step Fourier method (SSFM) simulations by treating SSFM numerical noise as an additive distributed noise source, much like amplified spontaneous emission and nonlinear interference. In this framework, we emphasize that the step size of a numerical simulation targeting a given error on the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) should be launch-power independent, and should scale inversely with the square of the signal bandwidth. From this we conclude that the commonly used nonlinear phase criterion for the step update along the distance is not optimal due to its power dependence and its unawareness of signal bandwidth. We propose a general criterion, based on four-wave mixing control, to set the first step of a series of exponentially increasing steps at the desired received SNR accuracy. Finally, we discuss the behavior of the SSFM accuracy versus step-size showing that at practical accuracies of interest the well-known arguments based on the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula may not hold, and explain how to set up a correct SSFM simulation to target an acceptable SNR error.},

QSM fibers can be designed to have much larger effective areas for the fundamental propagation mode than conventional single-mode fibers (SMFs). Signal transmission over the fundamental mode of QSM fibers can reduce distortion arising from the fiber Kerr nonlinearity. Random light coupling, however, among QSM fiber modes leads to multipath interference (MPI). Simultaneous reduction of nonlinear distortion and MPI can be achieved by using hybrid fiber spans, each composed of a QSM fiber segment to restrict nonlinear distortion, followed by an ultra-low-loss, large-effective-area SMF segment to suppress MPI.",

We analyze two typical high- and low-dispersion fiber types.
